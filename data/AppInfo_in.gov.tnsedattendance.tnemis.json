        "This app disappoints most of us. Many of us have to synchronise the data many times every day before marking the attendance. Even after marking the attendance we have to wait for a long time for auto synchronisation. What happens next is the greatest disappointment. The attendance summary doesn't tally with the total number of students. We are ready to accept this modernization. But this is a total waste of money, mobile data, human power and also time. I couldn't give even a star.",
        "The new version 4.0 of this app is irritating me. It is not allowing me to concentrate on my teaching. Very bad... Please rectify the issue. Now I updated to version 6.0 Whatever the update may be. Initially, the app asks us to sync the data. Even after repeating synchronization many times the app does not allow us to mark the attendance as soon as we login into the app. Kindly please take the necessary steps to rectify the issue. Almost, the time reaches 10 O'Clock to completing task.",
        "This is the worst app ever. I've never seen or thought anything like this app. due to the fact that every time I sync it, it displays Please sync. Finally, a half marked school list from my district office . How we operate it ... ? ... so, plz solve this problem...",
        "Guys You have to fix the bug issues... A lot of teachers are using this app for attendance... But they end up in disappointment.. Please update the app next time by fixing the issues and provide a good service to our teachers... Its very hard to use the app... Everything was working fine until your update... Update the app for lower android versions too..",
        "Only shows white screen ..Morning onwards struggling with the app. It makes the teachers very stress. Teaching process also affected beacause of this. Kindly request you to find a solution as early as possible for the best teaching learning atmosphere."
